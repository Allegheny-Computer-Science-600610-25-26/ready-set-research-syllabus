# CMPSC 610: Spring Semester of Two-Semester Senior Thesis Research

## Introduction

Your senior thesis process affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer science. This course parallels the kinds of intense
inquiry and research inherent to both academic life and a career as a computer
scientist, data scientist, or software engineer. To that end, you will work
closely with your readers to explore rich, ever-complex, projects. Though the
faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or challenge-free,
we invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to --- above all
--- find joy in the process.

### Assessment Categories

For the purposes of evaluation, this course is separated into both "primary" and
"secondary" requirements, as explained in the following table. This table
includes the name of the deliverable, its categorization as either a primary or
a secondary requirement, and the assigned percentage of the overall course
grade. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course coordinator may, for instance, change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.

|**Deliverable** |**Categorization** |**Percentage** |
|:----------------------|:------------------|:--------------|
|Research Notebook |Secondary |5% |
|Class Participation |Secondary |7.5% |
|Adviser Meetings |Secondary |7.5% |
|Computational Artifact |Primary |15% |
|Project Presentation |Primary |15% |
|Project Demonstration |Primary |15% |
|Final Thesis Chapters |Primary |35% |

**Requirements Summary**: To pass a `610`-level course in Computer and
Information Science, submission of and participation in all the primary
requirements is mandatory. In addition to an overall evaluation of each
category, a student's work in the `610`-level Computer and Information Science
course will be evaluated according to the baseline requirements outline in the
syllabus for the 600-level course.

**Assigning Assessments**: Please note that these requirements articulate a
baseline for the `610`-level course in Computer and Information Science and are
provided as a list of minimum requirements that all specific research
deliverables must meet to be assessed as complete. Before the submission of a
final grade, a student's assessment scores for these categories will be
initially assigned by their first reader, reviewed by their second reader,
approved by all faculty members who are instructors for a `610`-level course in
Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College.

**Double Majors**: Students who are enrolled in `DOUBL 610` are also required to
contract that describes the deliverables and the deadlines by which they will
complete them for both `610`-level course in Computer and Information Science
and the course for their additional major. Importantly, students in `DOUBL 610`
must complete _all_ the requirements for _both_ the `610`-level course in
Computer and Information Science _and_ the `610` course connected to their other
major. Students who enroll in `DOUBL 610` should submit their course contract to
both of their first readers and the coordinator of the `610`-level course in
Computer and Information Science.

**GitHub Repositories**: Please review the syllabus for the `600`-level course
to see the listing of the baseline requirements for all components of the senior
comprehensive project. Importantly, please note that the GitHub repositories
containing the final version of your computational artifact, any data sets and
data analysis routines, and your senior thesis and research notebook must be
finalized and linked to in the [metadata file](/metadata.md) file inside of
this repository. Importantly, all GitHub repositories created as a part of the
senior comprehensive project should be linked to through the [metadata
file](/metadata.md) file.

**Research Notebook**: As a vehicle for documenting and reflecting on your work
in the `610`-level course, the completed version of your online research
notebook should contain all entries from the `600`-level course and at least
three new entries focusing on (a) the iterative problem-solving and
decision-making process you followed to design, develop, and assess your
computational artifact, (b) a critical reflection on the results from your
project's empirical study, and (c) a detailed analysis of both the setbacks you
encountered and how you handled them and the consistent progress that you made
on your senior comprehensive project throughout both the `600`-level and
`610`-level courses.

### Institutional Review Board (IRB) Proposals

Should a project require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for use of
human subjects in the research project, the proposing student is responsible for
writing and having an approved IRB proposal before conducting any of the
experimentation associated with their undergraduate research. Students must
submit their IRB proposal to their First Reader who will review it and provide
feedback on it before submitting it to the IRB. In accordance with Allegheny
College policies, students may not submit their IRB proposal directly to the IRB
and may not start working on any of their experiments before receiving IRB
approval.

## Required Materials

### Course Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course.
However, the faculty _highly recommend_ investing in the following texts for
both academic and professional development:

|Title |Author |ISBN/ASIN |
|:-----|:------|:----|
|_On Being a Scientist (3rd ed.)_ |National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine |978-0309119702 |
|_BUGS in Writing: A Guide to Debugging your Prose_ |Lyn Dupre |978-0201379211 |
|_Writing for Computer Science (3rd ed.)_|Justin Zobel|978-1852338022 |
|_Published_|Thomas Deetjen|B085MQN3Q8 |

### Course Repositories

This course relies heavily on the [Computer and Information Science 600/610
Organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26). Your work
will be assigned and evaluated on and crucial communication distributed through
the GitHub platform. You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub
repositories for each of the assigned course projects. Repositories include
completion- and submission-specific instructions via `README` files. Many of
these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release PDFs of
your content with versions that adhere to the course's semantic versioning
standard. Students are invited to use the course's GitHub organization to create
and share their own GitHub repositories for the source code, documentation, and
data sets connected with their senior comprehensive project. Importantly, each
of these GitHub repositories created by students must adhere to all the
requirements in both the `600`-level and the `610`-level syllabus.

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are
stored in and properly released through GitHub repositories referenced in the
[metadata](/metadata.md) file.**

## Course Policies

### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the course coordinator at least one
week in advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of
illness should not attend any in-person course sessions. Even though students
with an illness are not required to attend class, they should communicate with
the course instructor to explain why they were absent.

### Email Policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on the [Computer
and Information Science 600/610 Organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26), the faculty
will also use email to communicate significant information. As with other the
GitHub platform used by this course, it is your responsibility to be accountable
for email communication.

### Syllabus Revision

The faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science reserve the
right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, they may
be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to
wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without
notice. Any change that impacts dates or significant changes in student
responsibility will be communicated --- in writing --- at least one week in
advance of the due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code.
Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the
eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer
and Information Science adds the following statement to the general college
policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course,
> and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with
> teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged.
> However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
> discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who
> produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
> else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to
> faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science are to be the
> original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in
> accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be
> taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of
> others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the
department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the
general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the
_Compass_. The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as
Stack Overflow or text generation systems such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.
Please review the policy on the use of artificial intelligence tools, referenced
in this syllabus, for more suggestions concerning the effective use of tools
like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.

### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to
act according to discipline-specific ethics.
The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

The course instructors recognize that use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools
such as Github Copilot, GPT, and Claude has emerged as a professional skill set
in the knowledge and practices our coursework covers. Department faculty
maintain a permissive attitude toward these tools by recognizing that you can
and will use them. We do so considering the following position:

> As a skill, using and correctly applying the results derived from AI tools is
> both context-based and discretion-worthy: these tools do not always provide
> correct or workable answers. Industry veterans and expert users run into many
> situations in which the responses these algorithms provide are plainly
> incorrect or unfit. In the context of department coursework, accepting an
> AI-generated answer wholesale or as a small part of an assignment may lead to
> less-than-satisfactory results in the context of both learning and deliverable
> quality.

> As a learner, your time at Allegheny is meant to impart the knowledge that
> enables you to judge the fitness of a given approach, regardless of its
> origin. In the same way that CIS students employ compilers, integrated
> development environments, and refactoring tools, the use of an AI tool is not
> a substitute for developing the fundamental skills that develop this
> awareness. Importantly, research demonstrates that relying on generated
> responses reduces a learner’s ability to durably learn these lessons and
> skills, suggesting that you should cautiously embrace the use of AI when you
> complete CIS coursework<sup>†</sup>.

Be prepared to support their use in ways including but not limited to:

- citing instances where code has been generated and clearly defining the tools
  that generated them
- providing descriptive commentary (including prompts) around generated code
  either in in-line comments or assignment documentation
- considering improvements to the generated code, documenting specifics about
  your modifications and reasoning behind them
- revising the generated code or documentation so as to ensure that it is more
  suitable for the purposes of your assignment

Faculty do not intend these requirements as a “gotcha”; we assume the best of
your effort. These guidelines follow industry best practices and prepare you for
integrating current and future generations of these AI technologies into your
set of computational skills.
