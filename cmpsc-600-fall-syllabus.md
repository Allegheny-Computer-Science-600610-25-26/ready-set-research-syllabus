# CMPSC 600: Fall Semester of Two-Semester Senior Thesis Research

## Outline

## Introduction

Your senior thesis process affords you the opportunity to pursue independent
research in computer science. This course parallels the kinds of intense inquiry
and research inherent to both academic life and a career as a computer
scientist, data scientist, or software engineer. To that end, you will work
closely with your readers to explore rich, ever-complex, projects. Though the
faculty cannot promise that this work will be frustration- or challenge-free, we
invite you to pursue it with great enthusiasm, vigor, and to -- above all --
find joy in the process.

## Course Description

Independent research in computer science, data science, informatics, or software
engineering, as further described in detail in the Learning Objectives section.

* Prerequisite: `CMPSC 580` or suitable equivalent for certain `600`-level
courses

## Assessment Strategy

### Assessment Categories

For the purposes of evaluation, this course is separated into both "primary" and
"secondary" requirements, as explained in the following table. This table
includes the name of the deliverable, its categorization as either a primary or
a secondary requirement, and the assigned percentage of the overall course
grade. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course coordinator may, for instance, change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.


|**Deliverable**        |**Categorization** |**Percentage** |
|:----------------------|:------------------|:--------------|
|Class Participation    |Secondary          |7.5%             |
|Adviser Meetings       |Secondary          |7.5%             |
|Research Notebook       |Secondary          |10%             |
|Computational Artifact |Primary            |15%            |
|Project Presentation   |Primary            |15%            |
|Project Demonstration  |Primary            |15%            |
|Two Thesis Chapters    |Primary            |30%            |


To pass a `600`-level course in Computer and Information Science, submission of
and participation in all the primary requirements is mandatory. In addition to
an overall evaluation of each category, a student's work in the `600`-level
Computer and Information Science course will be evaluated according to each of
the following baseline requirements. Please note that these requirements
articulate a baseline for the `600`-level course in Computer and Information
Science and are provided as a list of minimum requirements that all specific
research deliverables must meet to be assessed as complete. Before the
submission of a final grade, a student's assessment scores for these categories
will be initially assigned by their first reader, reviewed by their second
reader, and ultimately approved by all faculty members who are instructors for a
`600`-level course in Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College.

Students who are enrolled in `DOUBL 600` are also required to write a course
contract that describes the deliverables and the deadlines by which they will
complete them for both `600`-level course in Computer and Information Science
and the course for their additional major. Importantly, students in `DOUBL 600`
must complete _all_ the requirements for _both_ the `600`-level course in
Computer and Information Science _and_ the `600` course connected to their other
major. Students who enroll in `DOUBL 600` should submit their course contract to
both of their first readers and the coordinator of the `600`-level course in
Computer and Information Science.

writing and having an approved IRB proposal before conducting any of the
experimentation associated with their undergraduate research. Students must
submit their IRB proposal to their First Reader who will review it and provide
feedback on it before submitting it to the IRB. In accordance with Allegheny
College policies, students may not submit their IRB proposal directly to the IRB
and may not start working on any of their experiments before receiving IRB
approval.

### Additional Details

- A project presentation includes the following components with these time
limits:
    - Project presentation:  10 minutes
    - Demonstration of computation artifact: 3 minutes
    - Question and answer session: 2 minutes
    - Total time of presentation session: 15 minutes
- Presenting students must strictly adhere to the stated time limits.
- All students are required to attend and participate as audience members in all
of project presentations.
- Students must submit the first two chapters of their senior thesis document.
The thesis chapters are only required to adhere to those requirements that might
be reasonably completed during a `600`-level course in Computer and Information
Science. For instance, students are not required to have a senior thesis
document that meets the overall word count requirement until they have completed
a `610`-level course in Computer and Information Science. Students who have
questions about the assessment requirements for this `600`-level comprehensive
project are encouraged to contact their first reader and the course coordinator.

### Course Repositories

* [Computer and Information Science 600/610 Organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26)

This course relies heavily on the above GitHub organization. Your work will be
assigned and evaluated on and crucial communication distributed through the
GitHub platform. You are responsible for accepting and maintaining GitHub
repositories for each of the assigned course projects. Repositories include
completion- and submission-specific instructions via `README` files. Many of
these operations feature using GitHub's tagging mechanism to release PDFs of
your proposal with versions that adhere to the course's semantic versioning
standard. Students are invited to create and share their own GitHub repositories
for the source code, documentation, and data sets connected with their senior
comprehensive project.

**Course instructors will only grade and provide feedback on projects that are
stored in and properly released through GitHub.**

## Course Policies

### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions.
If, due to extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session,
then, whenever possible, please communicate with the course coordinator at least
one week in advance to describe your situation.
Students who have any signs of illness should not attend any in-person course
sessions.

### Email Policy

Despite the fact that the majority of our communication relies on the
[Allegheny College Computer Science 600/610 Organization on
GitHub](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-600610-25-26), the faculty
will also use email to communicate significant information. As with other the
GitHub platform used by this course, it is your responsibility to be accountable
for email communication.

### Syllabus Revision

The faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science reserve the
right to make changes to this syllabus document. Should a change occur, they may
be discussed with the members of the course community. Minor revisions to
wording that do not impact course events or deliverables may be made without
notice. Any change which impacts dates or significant changes in student
responsibility will be communicated -- in writing -- at least one week in
advance of the due date of the deliverable affected.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code.
Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the
eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer
and Information Science adds the following statement to the general college
policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course,
and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with
teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged.
However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who
produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to
faculty of the Department of Computer and Information Science are to be the
original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in
accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be
taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of
others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the
department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the
general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the
_Compass_. The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as
Stack Overflow or text generation systems such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.
Please review the policy on the use of artificial intelligence tools, referenced
in this syllabus, for more suggestions concerning the effective use of tools
like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.

### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to
act according to discipline-specific ethics.
The faculty encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools

The course instructors recognize that use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools
such as Github Copilot, GPT, and Claude has emerged as a professional skill set
in the knowledge and practices our coursework covers. Department faculty
maintain a permissive attitude toward these tools by recognizing that you can
and will use them. We do so considering the following position:

> As a skill, using and correctly applying the results derived from AI tools is
> both context-based and discretion-worthy: these tools do not always provide
> correct or workable answers. Industry veterans and expert users run into many
> situations in which the responses these algorithms provide are plainly
> incorrect or unfit. In the context of department coursework, accepting an
> AI-generated answer wholesale or as a small part of an assignment may lead to
> less-than-satisfactory results in the context of both learning and deliverable
> quality.

> As a learner, your time at Allegheny is meant to impart the knowledge that
> enables you to judge the fitness of a given approach, regardless of its
> origin. In the same way that CIS students employ compilers, integrated
> development environments, and refactoring tools, the use of an AI tool is not
> a substitute for developing the fundamental skills that develop this
> awareness. Importantly, research demonstrates that relying on generated
> responses reduces a learner’s ability to durably learn these lessons and
> skills, suggesting that you should cautiously embrace the use of AI when you
> complete CIS coursework<sup>†</sup>.

Be prepared to support their use in ways including but not limited to:

* citing instances where code has been generated and clearly defining the tools
that generated them
* providing descriptive commentary (including prompts) around generated code
either in in-line comments or assignment documentation
* considering improvements to the generated code, documenting specifics about
your modifications and reasoning behind them
* revising the generated code or documentation so as to ensure that it is more
suitable for the purposes of your assignment

Faculty do not intend these requirements as a “gotcha”; we assume the best of
your effort. These guidelines follow industry best practices and prepare you for
integrating current and future generations of these AI technologies into your
set of computational skills.
